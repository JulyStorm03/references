Static : is a keyword which identifies the class related thing. This means the given Method or variable is not instance related but Class related. It can be accessed without creating the instance of a Class.

void : is used to define the Return Type of the Method. It defines what the method can return. Void means the Method will not return any value.

main: is the name of the Method. This Method name is searched by JVM as a starting point for an application with a particular signature only.
